# Hummingbirds

Scripts and functions for processing and analysing movement data extracted from video recordings of hummingbirds 
using hidden Markov models. The data are first processed to create a dataset that can be analysed in the same 
way as tracking data would be, and then analysed using hidden Markov models.

The analyses in this repo are presented in the published paper David J. Pritchard, T. Andrew Hurly, Theoni Photopoulou, 
and Susan D. Healy. 2025. Applying movement ecology models to comparative cognition experiments: a field test in hummingbirds.
Proceedings of the Royal Society B, with doi 10.1098/rspb.2025.7017

The data can be found in the following location: https://zenodo.org/records/15028984
